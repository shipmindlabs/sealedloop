# sealedloop

An interview-loop engine: a frozen rubric, sealed independent scorecards, ratings only on
anchored levels backed by evidence, and a declared aggregation rule — so a hiring decision
can be traced back to what each interviewer actually observed.

This phase delivers the first invariant the rest of the engine leans on: **a rubric is
identified by the hash of its own content, and scorecards that rest on two different
rubrics are refused instead of averaged.**

## Requirements

Node 22.18 or newer. The package ships TypeScript sources and no dependencies; Node strips
the type annotations at load time.

## Use

```ts
import { assertSameRubric, createRubric, reviseRubric } from 'sealedloop';

const rubric = createRubric({
  role: 'Backend Engineer',
  competencies: [
    {
      id: 'systems-design',
      mustHave: true,
      bar: 3,
      anchors: [
        { level: 1, label: 'Novice', description: 'Sketches one service and stops there.' },
        { level: 2, label: 'Working', description: 'Weighs two designs and names the tradeoff.' },
        { level: 3, label: 'Strong', description: 'Designs for failure, load and rollback.' },
      ],
    },
  ],
});

rubric.rubricHash; // sha256 hex of the canonical form
Object.isFrozen(rubric); // true, all the way down

const revised = reviseRubric(rubric, { role: 'Backend Engineer II' });
revised.parent === rubric.rubricHash; // the old hash, kept as lineage

assertSameRubric([{ rubricHash: rubric.rubricHash }, { rubricHash: revised.rubricHash }]);
// throws SealedLoopError with code RUBRIC_MISMATCH, naming both hashes
```

## How the hash is formed

`canonicalize` serializes a value per RFC 8785: object keys sorted by UTF-16 code unit,
numbers in ECMAScript form, and every string NFC-normalized first — so `"caf\u00e9"` and
`"cafe\u0301"` reach the same bytes. Values with no canonical form are refused rather than
coerced: `NaN`, `Infinity`, `undefined`, lone surrogates, cycles, and anything that is not
a plain object or array. `rubricHash` is the SHA-256 hex digest of that canonical form,
computed over the role, the parent hash and the ordered competencies.

## Errors

Every failure is a `SealedLoopError` carrying a string `code`: `CANONICAL_*` for values with
no canonical form, `INVALID_RUBRIC` for a rubric that cannot be frozen as given,
`RUBRIC_MISMATCH`, `EMPTY_CARD_SET` and `MISSING_RUBRIC_HASH` for scorecard sets.

## Tests

```sh
npm test
```

## Limits

- Only the rubric layer exists today. Scorecards are treated as anything carrying a
  `rubricHash`; sealing, evidence capture, rating validation against anchors and the
  declared aggregation rule are still to come.
- A hash is an identity, not a signature. It proves two parties scored the same rubric
  text; it does not prove who wrote it or when, and anyone can recompute it.
- Canonicalization covers the JSON data model only — no dates, maps, sets, class
  instances, `bigint` or symbols. Pass those as strings or numbers.
- NFC normalization makes visually identical text hash alike; it does not defend against
  look-alike characters from different scripts.
- `reviseRubric` records a single `parent` hash. Lineage is a chain, not a merge graph, and
  nothing here stores past revisions for you.
- Anchor levels must be integers in strictly ascending order and the bar must be one of
  them. Half-levels and per-interviewer bars are out of scope.
- No persistence, no transport, no identity model.
